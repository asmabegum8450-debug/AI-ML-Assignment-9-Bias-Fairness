Overview
This repository contains the complete implementation for Assignment 9: Bias Detection and Mitigation using AIF360. The goal is to analyze bias in the Adult Census Income dataset, apply a mitigation technique, and compare fairness and accuracy.
Baseline vs Mitigated Summary
Metric	Baseline	Mitigated	Change
Accuracy	0.84	0.82	-0.02
Disparate Impact	0.69	0.92	+0.23
Statistical Parity Difference	-0.18	-0.05	+0.13
Fairness–Accuracy Trade-Off
The mitigated model shows reduced bias after applying Reweighing, at the cost of a small decrease in accuracy. This trade-off is expected and acceptable for fairness-focused applications.
